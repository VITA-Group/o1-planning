We evaluated the GPT4 and o1 on planning tasks, highlighting their strength in problem understanding and identifying challenges in spatial reasoning and generalization.

## TODO List
We will update the detailed information and share access to more files soon. 
- [ ] Released detail experiments evaluation
- [ ] project page 
- [ ] Automation script (this would be take a while to format)
